# 2048 Game

### A brief description of the project:

This project is a web-based implementation of the popular 2048 game. The goal of the game is to combine tiles with the same number, doubling their value, until you reach the number 2048. The game is built to closely replicate the gameplay and functionality of the original version found [here](https://play2048.co/). The interface is intuitive, and the project showcases a solid understanding of game logic, JavaScript, and DOM manipulation.

### Technologies that were used:

- **HTML5**: Used for the structure of the game board and overall layout.
- **CSS3**: Employed for the styling of the game interface and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: Used for implementing the game logic, including tile movement, score calculation, and merging behavior.
- **Webpack**: Used for bundling the projectâ€™s assets and dependencies.
